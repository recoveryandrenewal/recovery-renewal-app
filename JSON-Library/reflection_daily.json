We suffer when we obsess, when we cling and grasp onto all of the delusions of addiction, all the impermanent solutions to our discomfort and pain. The cycle of craving, using, and the consequences that follow—this is dukkha, the fundamental dissatisfaction that pervades our addictive experience.",
