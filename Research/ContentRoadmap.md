RECOVERY & RENEWAL - DAILY READING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📖 Today's Spiritual Reading

TRADITION: Buddhism
SOURCE: The Dhammapada (verse 161)

———————————————————————————————————————

"Better than a thousand hollow words
is one word that brings peace.
Better than a thousand hollow verses
is one verse that brings peace."

———————————————————————————————————————

💭 Reflection:
In recovery, we often hear conflicting advice. This verse reminds us that 
simplicity—one clear truth applied daily—builds more solid sobriety than 
endless analysis. What is ONE principle you're working with today?

🧘 Today's Practice (7 min):
Breath awareness meditation (audio link)

💬 Step Reflection:
If working a program, reflect on today's step through this lens:
"What one truth do I need to focus on in this step?"

💪 Recovery Affirmation:
"I trust the simple path. One day at a time, I am building my freedom."
