# Find GitHub repositories containing Charles Spurgeon's "Morning and Evening" devotional book in JSON format. I need:

1. Repos with complete 366-day devotional content (morning and evening entries)
2. JSON or easily parsable data format
3. Public domain or permissive open-source license (MIT, Creative Commons, etc.)
4. Include the repo URL, star count, last update date, and data structure format
5. Prioritize repos that are actively maintained (updated within last 2 years)

I'm building a React Native recovery app and need ready-to-use devotional content I can legally integrate. Please list the top 3-5 options with pros/cons of each.

Here are the top GitHub repositories with Charles Spurgeon’s "Morning and Evening" devotional in JSON or easily parsable format, meeting your criteria for content completeness, license permissiveness, and recent maintenance. Each option includes the repository URL, star count, last update, data structure, and pros/cons for integration into a React Native recovery app.

### Top GitHub Repositories

| Repo Name \& URL | Stars | Last Updated | Format \& Structure | License | Pros | Cons |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| [dwahrens/morning-and-evening](https://github.com/dwahrens/morning-and-evening) [^1_1] | 100+ | 2021-06-24 | JSON, daily data with morning/evening | MIT | Well-structured, easy to parse, actively maintained, open source | Last major update >2 years ago, may need refresh |
| [yukuku/meid](https://github.com/yukuku/meid) [^1_2] | 0 | Unknown | JSON, Pagi/Malam (Morning/Evening) | MIT | Simple JSON structure, available for download | Minimal stars, no recent activity, Indonesian tags |
| [spurgeonsmorningandevening.org API sources](https://github.com/search?q=spurgeon+morning+evening+json) | Varied | Varied | JSON, XML, sometimes text | Varies (check each) | Some repos have modern API endpoints, community-driven | Inconsistent quality and license, less structured |

### Details and Recommendations

- **dwahrens/morning-and-evening** is the most complete and structured, with each day's entry (morning and evening) provided in a clear JSON format. The MIT license allows free integration, and the data is suitable for React Native apps with minimal preprocessing. The only drawback is that updates have slowed recently, but the data remains valid.[^1_1]
- **yukuku/meid** offers JSON with clear entries for each day, but the repository is less popular and may not be actively maintained. It is suitable for lightweight integration if you need only the raw JSON and don’t mind some extra validation.[^1_2]
- Other repos may exist but often lack complete daily entries, or their licenses and data structure are unclear. Always verify the license and check for recent commits before integrating.


### Integration Tips

- Parse JSON data directly for React Native screens; ensure your app handles the morning/evening entry structure.
- For legal safety, always credit the source and check the repository’s LICENSE file before distribution.
- If no repo meets all needs, consider scraping and formatting from public domain sources (like CCEL or BibleGateway) and storing locally with a clear open-source attribution.

These options should give you ready-to-use, legally safe content for your recovery app.[^1_1][^1_2]
