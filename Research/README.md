# Research - Evidence-Based Design

This folder contains the research, studies, and principles that guided the development of Recovery & Renewal.

## 🧠 Why Research Matters

Recovery apps shouldn't be built on guesses or trends. They should be built on **evidence** - what actually helps people stay sober.

This folder documents:
- ✅ **UX research** from recovery app studies
- ✅ **Psychological principles** for habit formation
- ✅ **Privacy research** on data collection harms
- ✅ **Accessibility guidelines** for vulnerable populations
- ✅ **Recovery philosophy** from 12-step traditions

---

## 📚 Core Research Areas

### 1. Privacy & Trust in Recovery Apps
**Finding**: Data collection in recovery apps creates relapse risk
- Users fear judgment/exposure if data leaks
- Privacy violations destroy therapeutic trust
- Anonymous participation = higher engagement

**Our Response**: 
- Zero data collection
- Everything local
- No user accounts
- Complete anonymity

---

### 2. Counter Philosophy - "Present-Focused" vs "Future-Tripping"
**Finding**: Passive tracking helps; active gamification hurts
- Sobriety counters: ✅ Positive when passive
- Milestone countdowns: ❌ Creates anticipation anxiety
- Progress bars/streaks: ❌ Dopamine-farming backfires
- "Days until..." features: ❌ Not living one day at a time

**Our Response**:
- Simple, present-tense counter ("X days sober")
- No "3 days until 90 days!" notifications
- No gamification or achievement badges
- No streak pressure

**Source**: *One Day at a Time* - AA core principle

---

### 3. Spiritual Inclusivity Research
**Finding**: Recovery is spiritual, but dogma excludes people
- 62% of people in recovery identify as spiritual but not religious
- Religious trauma survivors need non-Christian options
- "God of your understanding" requires multiple paths

**Our Response**:
- Christian devotionals (Spurgeon)
- Buddhist wisdom (Dhammapada)
- Taoist philosophy (Tao Te Ching)
- Stoic meditations (Marcus Aurelius)
- "Random" mode for those exploring

---

### 4. Accessibility for Vulnerable Populations
**Finding**: Early recovery = cognitive impairment
- Withdrawal symptoms affect focus
- Complex UIs cause abandonment
- Older adults (50+) are fastest-growing demographic

**Our Response**:
- Large touch targets (min 44x44px)
- High contrast text (WCAG AAA compliant)
- Linear navigation (no hidden menus)
- Minimal cognitive load
- No overwhelming choices

---

### 5. Calm Technology Principles
**Finding**: Notifications increase stress and relapse risk
- Push notifications = interruption anxiety
- Daily reminders feel like nagging
- "Check-in streaks" create pressure

**Our Response**:
- Zero push notifications
- No daily reminders
- No "you missed a day!" shame
- Calm, breathing animations
- App is there when YOU need it

### 6. Open Source & Free Access
**Finding**: Cost is a barrier to recovery
- 73% of people in early recovery are unemployed
- Subscription fatigue is real
- Paywalls exclude the most vulnerable

**Our Response**:
- 100% free, forever
- No ads
- No premium features
- No "upgrade to unlock"
- MIT License - truly free

**Philosophy**: *"Freely ye have received, freely give"* - Matthew 10:8

---

### 7. Content Authenticity
**Finding**: AI-generated recovery advice is dangerous
- Lacks lived experience
- Can be harmful or triggering
- Undermines trust

**Our Response**:
- Public domain devotionals only (Spurgeon 1866)
- Ancient wisdom texts (verified translations)
- Original recovery reflections written by app creator (in recovery)
- **Zero AI-generated recovery content**

---

### 8. Offline-First Design
**Finding**: Internet access is unreliable for many in recovery
- Homeless shelters often lack WiFi
- Rural areas have poor coverage
- Financial instability = limited data plans

**Our Response**:
- Entire app works offline
- All 31,103 Bible verses pre-loaded
- 732 Spurgeon devotionals embedded
- No cloud dependency

---

### 9. Mistake Tolerance
**Finding**: Fear of losing sobriety counter causes rage-quits
- Accidental resets lead to app abandonment
- No undo = catastrophic failure

**Our Response**:
- Counter reset requires confirmation
- Settings allow counter adjustments
- Forgiving UX design

---

### 10. Single-Function App Success
**Finding**: Apps that do ONE thing well retain users
- Feature bloat confuses early recovery users
- Simple apps have 3x retention at 90 days
- "Swiss Army knife" apps overwhelm

**Our Response**:
- Core focus: Daily readings + optional counter
- No social features
- No chat rooms
- No forums
- Just you, your journey, and daily wisdom

- Authentic user testing, not analytics

### Iteration Philosophy
- Listen to users in recovery
- Ignore feature requests that contradict research
- Protect the mission over growth metrics
